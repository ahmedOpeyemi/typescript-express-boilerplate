# Node.js, Express and TS Boilerplate for Web apps with VS Code tasks

This is a minimalistic boilerplate for building web applications using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The boilerplate also contains VS Code launch configurations to help you run and debug your code.
